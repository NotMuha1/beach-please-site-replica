This site is a fan-made replica of the official BEACH, PLEASE! website — created specifically for our vibrant Roblox community that has brought the iconic festival to life inside the platform.

What started as a passion project quickly turned into a full-blown virtual festival experience, built by fans who wanted to recreate the unforgettable energy of BEACH, PLEASE! in the metaverse. From the massive stages and beachfront vibes to music, dancing, games, and social hangouts — every detail has been designed to capture the spirit of the real event.

Whether you're here to explore the festival grounds, dance with friends, discover hidden surprises, or just vibe out under the virtual sun, this is your ultimate destination. The party doesn’t stop when the music fades — it just moves to Roblox.
